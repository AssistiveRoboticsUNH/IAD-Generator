# IAD-Generator
The provided files allow for the generation and evaluation of Interval Algebraic Descriptors (IADs). IADs are generated from contemporary 3D-CNN architectures, we specifically focused on C3D and I3D. The generated IADs were evaluated using an ensemble model which we provide.

# Installation



# Training C3D/I3D


# Generating IADs


# Evaluating IADs

To execute run: python iad_gen.py

you will need to set the variables for the threshold options and compression options

python iad_generator.py ~/i3d/train_i3d/experiments/ucf-101/models/ucf_i3d_pretrained_01_100/model.ckpt ~/datasets/UCF-101/listFiles/trainlist01_100.list


ToDo: imporve ReadMe file, include examples
